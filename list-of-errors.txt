3. Git: 
To untrack a single file that has already been added/initialized to your repository, i.e., stop tracking the file but not delete it from your system use: 
git rm --cached filename

To untrack every file that is now in your .gitignore:
First commit any outstanding code changes, and then, run this command:
git rm -r --cached .

This removes any changed files from the index(staging area), then just run:
git add .

Commit it:
git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"

Delete the most recent commit, keeping the work you've done:
git reset --soft HEAD~1

Delete the most recent commit, destroying the work you've done:
git reset --hard HEAD~1
